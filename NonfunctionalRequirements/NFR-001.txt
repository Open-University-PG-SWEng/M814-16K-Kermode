REQ-ID:		NFR001
Description:	The user should receive a timely response from the system after initiating the
		payment process.
Type:		Non-functional (performance)
Rationale:	Users are naturally extremely anxious after entering payment details into a website and
		awaiting a response. A quick response will avoid the user attempting to refresh their 
		webpage, trying to initiate the payment a second time, or closing down the window 
		completely (and abandoning the order).
Fit Criterion:	A response from the payment gateway is received within a maximum 15 second window.
Originator:	Jason Robson

[JasonRobson] Updated the type to state it is related to system performance.

[DK] I know 15 seconds seems like a long time, but what is the rationale for choosing a maximum of 15 seconds?  Maybe its worth also adding an additional constraint of the number of requests that must meet this criteria, so a certain percentage of those payments should be processed within the time limit.  It could be difficult otherwise as the system isnâ€™t the payment provider, its reliant on a 3rd party.
