REQ-ID:		NFR001
Description:	The user should receive a timely response from the system after initiating the
		payment process.
Type:		Non-functional (performance)
Rationale:	Users are naturally extremely anxious after entering payment details into a website and
		awaiting a response. A quick response will avoid the user attempting to refresh their 
		webpage, trying to initiate the payment a second time, or closing down the window 
		completely (and abandoning the order).
Fit Criterion:  The user receives a response after initiating payment withing a maximum 15 second window.
Originator:	Jason Robson

[JasonRobson] Updated the type to state it is related to system performance.

[DK] I know 15 seconds seems like a long time, but what is the rationale for choosing a maximum of 15 seconds?  Maybe its worth also adding an additional constraint of the number of requests that must meet this criteria, so a certain percentage of those payments should be processed within the time limit.  It could be difficult otherwise as the system isn’t the payment provider, its reliant on a 3rd party.  

[DW] I think for the fit criterion we should be looking at the response received by the user, since it may be that it is necessary tha system handles the payment provider response to present the user update. 

[JR] Good points! I've updated the Fit Criterion from:
	Fit Criterion:	A response from the payment gateway is received within a maximum 15 second window.
to:
	Fit Criterion:  The user receives a response after initiating payment withing a maximum 15 second window.
