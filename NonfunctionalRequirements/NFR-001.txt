REQ-ID:		NFR001
Description:	The user should receive a timely response from the system after initiating the
		payment process.
Type:		Non-functional (performance)
Rationale:	Users are naturally extremely anxious after entering payment details into a website and
		awaiting a response. A quick response will avoid the user attempting to refresh their 
		webpage, trying to initiate the payment a second time, or closing down the window 
		completely (and abandoning the order).
Fit Criterion:	A response from the payment gateway is received within a maximum 15 second window.
