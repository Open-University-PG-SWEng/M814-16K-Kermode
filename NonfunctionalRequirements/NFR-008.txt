REQ-ID: NFR-008
Description: The product shall allow the user to record the delivery of supplies quickly.
Type: 11
Rationale: It shall be quick as it should not take much longer than the old process of checking off ordered supplies in a spreadsheet.
Fit Criterion: Across a range of delivery sizes (measured with statistical significance of 95%) an administrator shall be able to record delivered supplies in at most 20% more time than they could have if they had checked off ordered supplies in a spreadsheet.

[KK] I believe that the phrase "statistically representative range" with a theoretically agreed percentage. There's also a typo in statistically. As for the type (12 Performance) I believe that this NFR falls also under the category "Usability and Humanity Requirements" in the sense that the duration is not really dependent on the performance of a system process but rather on the user's behaviour.

[JT] I feel that an increase of 50% in the time taken to carry out this activity may be a lot. One of the reasons for creating WIMS was in order to save time and streamline their processes - if things now take that much longer, will the product be acceptable?

[GG] I agree with JT that taking up to 50% longer may not be acceptable, unless it is countered by some other visible benefit, such as a reduction in errors.
