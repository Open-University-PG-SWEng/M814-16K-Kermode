REQ-ID: NFR-008
Description: The product shall allow the user to record the delivery of supplies quickly.
Type: 12
Rationale: It shall be quick as it should not take much longer than the old process of checking off ordered supplies in a spreadsheet.
Fit Criterion: Across a statuistically representative range of delivery sizes an administrator shall be able to record delivered supplies in at most 50% more time than they could have if they had checked off ordered supplies in a spreadsheet.

[KK] I believe that the phrase "statistically representative range" with a theoretically agreed percentage. 
As for the type (12 Performance) I believe that this NFR falls also under the category "Usability and Humanity Requirements" in the sense that the duration is not really dependent on the performance of a system process but rather on the user's behaviour.
