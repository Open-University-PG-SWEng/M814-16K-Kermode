REQ-ID: 	012
Description: 	It should be easy for members to reserve a place on a course.
Type:		Useability.
Rationale:	This is a new product and we need members to use this way of booking courses.
Fit Criterion:	Ninety percent of members should be able to complete the online reservation on 
		their first attempt.
Originator:	Member.
Comments: 	[M814-MJC] NFR attached to FR #13

[AG] I think the requirement would become clearer if the fit criterion would include testing for more than just the ability to complete the reservation, encompassing testing for both effectiveness and efficiency. Efficiency metrics would include time to completion and number of clicks to completion. The fit criterion would probably be realistically tested on a representative subset of users, as opposed to the more generic members in the original criteria. 

[TB] I think that the rational should provide more in-depth information to understand the requirement. Why do we want the members to make online reservations, what type of member with what skills do we want to attract? This would also help to derive a more precise fit criterion. 

[DW] I agree that both rationale and fit criterion could be added to. It would definitely be good to expand on the fit criterion a little.

[PG] The fit criterion references a percentage that is dependant on probability or reliability, however a reservation is based on availablity (the reliability of the system is implied in that it should be reliable and so no percentage required). First attempt is an expectation unless availability of either the booking or system access was an issue. In short it is the form or controls that govern simplicity and not reliability or percentage of users(unless this refers to loading of the system/ network/ connections which is a system level).
