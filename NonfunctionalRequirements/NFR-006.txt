Type: Non-functional – ease of use
Rationale: Accessing membership information is a core functionality that will likely be carried out frequently; it should not be a complex procedure.
Fit Criterion: Trained staff should be able to access a specific member’s membership information in no more than 3 mouse clicks.
Originator: Jen Truby

[JT] I have specified 3 mouse clicks because this is such a core functionality, many more would likely result in frustration from staff at having to navigate some complex set of menus/options.
