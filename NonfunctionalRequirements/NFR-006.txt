[JT] I have specified 3 mouse clicks because this is such a core functionality, many more would likely result in frustration from staff at having to navigate some complex set of menus/options.

[AS] Just for added clarification, would this be 3 mouse clicks after searching for a member’s name? Or prior to searching for their name? Or would this be without searching but navigating to their details from a lookup function.
