REQ-ID: NFR010
Description: A supply order shall be updated quickly.
Type: Non-Functional - Performance
Rationale: The supply order needs to be updated quickly in response to a facilitators request to ensure that supplies are available for a workshop. To avoid multiple being sent to the same supplier a consolidated supply order shall be sent at 15:00 each day; all pertinent orders received prior to 15:00 must be included.
Fit Criterion: The supply order shall be updated within 20 seconds for 90% of requests, and 100% of requests shall be updated within 1 minute of input into the product.

[CB] Assumption is that the order will be output in a form that the administrators must then forward to the supplier this could be electronically or manually etc... This NFR relates to REQ017.

[AG] On page 288 of MRP a more detailed fit criterion is suggest for a similar NFR. I suggest that the specification can be improved by setting a target threshold for the majority of users (say, 20 seconds for 90% of requests) and then an upper bound for exceptional cases (say 1 minute at the maximum).

[TB] I think this is a reasonable requirement but I see a possible use case where it does not make sense. It could be that the different orders are collected first and only one single consolidated order is sent per supplier and per day to save shipping costs or to receive better conditions.

[CB] Requirement specification updated in response to review comments.
