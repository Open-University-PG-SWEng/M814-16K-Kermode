REQ-ID: NFR007Description: The system should be reliable such that relevant, up-to-date management reports are generated on a monthly basis. Type: Non-Functional - ReliabilityRationale: A reliable management report will have relevant and up-to-date information and will therefore enable a more accurate comparison of current performance against both previous and planned performance and influence future decision-making.Fit Criterion: A management report is automatically generated and shared with Justin and Marion on the first day of each month. Originator: Ashni SedaniComments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.[AS] I believe only Justin and Marion require this information so have not included other stakeholders. I have selected the first of each month for consistency.[BH] Your fit criterion is very good, I don't recall the module specifying the first of the month but it's a relatively reasonable assumption this would suit their needs. My concern would be for the definition of 'management report'. What is one? And how can I verify that it's successfully generated if I don't know what one is/should contain?

[JT] I know you have said that you specified Justin and Marion because you thought that they would be the only ones that needed it - but if another stakeholder turned out to need it, or if Marion/Justin left before the project was complete, would it not be better to have a more open option? Perhaps the list of stakeholders to whom the report should be sent could be kept in a supporting document?
