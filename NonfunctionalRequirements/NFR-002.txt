REQ-ID: NFR002
Description: The system must log that the workshop schedule has been changed for audit purposes
Type: Security
Rationale: It must be possible to trace who is changing the schedule of a workshop.  Otherwise, changes cannot be traced back to who modified it - which may not have been the facilitator.
Fit Criterion: An audit entry is generated for every change to the workshop schedule indicating the following: who made the changed, the previous schedule, and the new schedule

[JR] I'd wondering whether this is actually a non-functional requirement ? I'd say the ability
to maintain an audit log to allow user accountability and traceability represents a specific behaviour 
of the system? I'm not sure it falls under the remit of 'security' ?
