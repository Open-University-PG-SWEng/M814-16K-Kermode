REQ-ID: NFR002
Description: The system must log that the workshop schedule has been changed for audit purposes
Type: Security
Rationale: It must be possible to trace who is changing the schedule of a workshop.  Otherwise, changes cannot be traced back to who modified it - which may not have been the facilitator.
Fit Criterion: An audit entry is generated for every change to the workshop schedule indicating the following: who made the changed, the previous schedule, and the new schedule
