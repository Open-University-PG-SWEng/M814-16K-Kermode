REQ-ID: NFR002
Description: The system must log that the workshop schedule has been changed for audit purposes
Type: Security
Rationale: It must be possible to trace who is changing the schedule of a workshop.  Otherwise, changes cannot be traced back to who modified it - which may not have been the facilitator.
Fit Criterion: An audit entry is generated for every change to the workshop schedule indicating the following: who made the changes, the previous schedule, and the new schedule

[JR] I'd wondering whether this is actually a non-functional requirement ? I'd say the ability
to maintain an audit log to allow user accountability and traceability represents a specific behaviour 
of the system? I'm not sure it falls under the remit of 'security' ?

[DK] According to MRP (page 264-265), audit trails come under the security aspect of non-functional requirements. Also, as it doesnâ€™t alter the functional behaviour of the system, it would be considered non-functional.  There could well be a higher level requirement to maintain an audit trail, but how do you deem from that requirement what is actually going to audit? It provides a testable way of being able to determine that schedule changes are audited.

[DW] A small typo under Fit Criterion: changed = changes. I think security in some cases could both be NFR and FR depending on how it's worded.

[DK] Thanks for the typo spot! Updated.

[GG] I agree that this requirement may be difficult to classify. It is certainly concerned with security, but as it generates an audit entry for every schedule change, it does alter the functional behaviour of the system, although this is not visible to the user who made the schedule change.
